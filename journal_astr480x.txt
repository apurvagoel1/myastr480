Report on the scientific paper:

“Remember to think of a paper as a collection of experimental results, summarized as clearly and economically as possible in figures, tables, equations, and schemes. The text in the paper serves just to explain the data, and is secondary. “
This statement stood out to me, although I knew that the point is to convey the data, but I always thought about papers as data supporting an argument rather than argument supporting the data; but it makes sense—the latter way to think about it would probably encourage bias in research, and that's not what science is about.


Create an outline for research docs/think of a doc text as a medium to explaining data.
WEEK 2

wk of Apr 4th journaling

NOTE apr 30th-may 1st apo viewing window--mark the calender!!!

Choosing quasars as objects to observe at Lowell Observtory at Flagstaff,Arizona 
ryan wanted to take owndership of the class assignment, so on wednesday he was done with the code. I had similar code, and helped tweak some logical things, but it was largely his effort. We basically used the built in astroplan libraries for observability to account for constraints like moon phase and moon separation, airmass, etc. We decided to check the observability on Dec1 and Dec15 and hoped to deduce a trend over the 2 weeks. 

We found data, but it wasn't the right format, and we had some trouble download it as a .csv file, which ryan had preferred to use, so we essentially used google sheets to convert the RA and DEC values into a readable archours/deg format separable by commas. Ryan also suggested we throw out moon separation because at the high values we'd set, it didnt matter. 

We struggled to find meaningful plots since we kept using really unvaried data. Ultimately we chose to  randomize our selection of QSO's from the Large Bright Quasar Survey Catalog accessible at heasarc and tried to find and stick with higher right ascensionsfor more interesting viewing windows. 
 
We found a surprising result, despite most objects being unobservable in the beginning of december, many more were visible over the end of our viewing window. Anyway I will double check this over the weekend, since the due date for the assignment was changed to Monday, as a lot of people in class were lagging behind. JskyView is an excellent quick tool to double check your work. I had a bit of trouble understanding its format so i need to keep practicing till its easy 
 
 This week's lab also introduced me to a lot of astronomy terms which I have only explored through random youtube tutorials and conveniently forgotten. For example, the angles in the celestial sphere are a bit of a messy struggle for me to visualize, so i need to sit and go over it again...although the lab just asked for basic stuff and no calculations using them... so i was able to do it all on my own. 
_______


CCD
mirrors correct for aberration 

ph—electron 
detector controllers
stefan boltzmann
flux is inversely proportional to distance
dust lets red light through so we have data in IR
pogson’s ratio 
break a pixel into more and more pixel—resolve to get details in ccd
over resolving will make the image lose its quality
differential vs absolute photometry
how to measure the flux of a round star with square pixels? 


_______________________________________________________
running data throught eh SAO image viewer and learning how to assess the details is a bit challenging, because even though th eprogram itself is easy to use, it is not clear to me how to interpret the differences between the regions of analysis.. Need a stronger astro foundation and need to learn what each of these terms mean. 
Project proposal--still working on finding something doable. I don't really know yet but i will research on it more over the weekend. 
___________________________________________________-
for research project--i want to look at archival data for a galaxy in the local group... perghaps ngc 1569 which has 100x the sfr than the milky way, maybe look it its surface gas distribution if i can find the real data

flatness by either side of the overscan--how much light is hitting the detector
SAOimage viewer : wcs-ra and dec; 
poisson dist vs guassian dist--- all dist functions->as we get higher numbers, poissons start to look guassian
in general 65k counts saturation point for the chips we'll look at. 
photon noise= poisson noise. that dist looks similar to guassian w higher numbers. 
bias frame= readout from 0 region- no light ...or overscan.
variations in the ccd will be normal around bias. if bias was 0, we'll have half the values as negative. analog->digital would mean losing quality, and  thus information. spo bias is usually on the order of few hundred counts. bias indicates ccd characteristics. 

header--where the telescope is pointed. based on amplifier amd the information calibration, we position the telescope for ideal angles and brightness. ned tells you the center of the field. the difference in ra and dec are accounted for there.

wash-m filter-mostly broadband filter-avoid skylines--faint background lines.almost never used. filters make a big difference. you lose extra light using a different filter in 1 observation, vs another, based on design. thats why apo image might look different from the flatfits file. because of the optical path design, things may vary.. 

spectrum---emission lines from the galaxy... slit... read up;

pixels--once saturated to full capacity, will get spill over--diffraction spike. sometimes the str is so bright, over exposure can spill photons to the next pixel. readout image. ccds just count the interval rather than when a photon arrived in the image. once ccd has photons on it, they have to be moved to be counted. several places in the pkg might count(not ccd). charge packets shared between 2 pixels. lil voltage alteration changes the potential well 

undersampling is a problem. its better to have a slightly bigger /reasonable size of pixels than a super small on efor this reason. in our phones for example. ///reference--cheap 2k detector///

if exposure short..readout long, then overhead? old ccds had this issue. depends on the gen of detector, and also amplifier functionality
Quantum efficiency vs Wavelength 
metal deposited coatings cut down on light reflections getting weird. 

when ccds are warm they have a lot more motion and thus noise. Dark current? scales with time. bias alway stays more or less the same.. extra signals need to be avoided for better accuracy of data. to cold= lower quantum efficiency. sooo its a nice balance.

high UV ---ccds dont work.. high energy electrons just pass right through the coating. material science is also unpredictable. no hope for any vast improvements in quantum efficiency through thatin  the near future , but possibly the closest field to have any hope at all... hah...


DN = digital number /... electrons per count.

KEY cfeatures 

CCDS--linear regime. to a point. pixels saturate. gain is an intrinsic measurable value. optical responsive.. materials limits. ccds are cheap.

CMOS vs CCDs. CCDs WIN ALL THE WAYYYYY STRUCTURALLL:Y as many of the continuous photos as we can(lenslit arrays, but limits to that)
Microchannel Plates are frequently used for UV and XRAYs. photon comes in-- cascade of electrons. Satellites.....amplification.. some benefits, some not. fragile, expensive. 

Signal to Noise ratio:not always better to have more signal! depends on incentive/experiment.
Shot noise: no way to quanitfy distribution of # of photons coming in over time

read noise

About to learn how to reduce data for the first time! 

http://www.astropy.org/astropy-tutorials/plot-catalog.html

http://python4astronomers.github.io/core/numpy_scipy.html

It is a great tutorial. I managed to substract enough data from the original to see the final signal. Now if only I can practice enough to do this in my sleep..
